#  Metadata Quality Audit
Ensuring high-quality metadata across the entire Swiss Confederation administration.


## Description
The **Metadata Quality Audit** is the backend system which drives the [Metadata Quality Dashboard](https://dashboard.opendata.swiss/), supporting metadata excellence across all levels of the Swiss public sector—federal administration, cantons, and communes alike.

This repository is divided into two systems:
* **Data Loader** – A data pipeline that retrieves metadata from [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss/en), audits it, and computes quality scores.
* **REST API** – A flexible and structured interface to expose audit results for integration with dashboards and visual tools.

The system was developed to address inconsistencies in open data metadata and enable quality monitoring at scale. It supports Switzerland's commitment to high-quality [Open Government Data (OGD)](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/services/ogd.html), in alignment with the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and the [Metadata Quality Assessment (MQA)](https://data.europa.eu/mqa/methodology?locale=en) by data.europa.eu.

### Key Features
* Standards-based metadata auditing (FAIR, MQA)
* Automated scoring and tracking over time
* RESTful API for flexible data consumption
* Powers the official public-facing dashboard
